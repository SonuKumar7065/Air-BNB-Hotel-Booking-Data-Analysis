## üßÆ Predictive Model ‚Äî Price Prediction  

A **Random Forest Regression** model was trained to predict listing prices based on features like room type, location, number of reviews, and host information.  

**Model Performance:**  
| Metric | Score |
|---------|-------|
| MAE (Mean Absolute Error) | ‚âà 25.7 |
| RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) | ‚âà 41.2 |
| R¬≤ Score | 0.87 |

‚úÖ The model accurately captured pricing patterns, providing insights for dynamic pricing strategies.
