## 🎯 Learning Objectives  

By completing this project, the following objectives were achieved:  

1. **Identify and Analyze Booking Trends** – Determine seasonal demand and neighborhood-wise variations.  
2. **Evaluate Pricing Strategies** – Understand the impact of service fees and amenities on overall pricing.  
3. **Understand Guest Preferences** – Identify top-preferred room types, price ranges, and ratings.  
4. **Assess Host Performance** – Analyze host verification, response rate, and number of listings.  
5. **Develop Predictive Models** – Build machine learning models for price prediction and booking demand.  
6. **Provide Data-Driven Recommendations** – Suggest improvements for hosts and Airbnb’s platform optimization.

## 🧮 Predictive Model — Price Prediction  

A **Random Forest Regression** model was trained to predict listing prices based on features like room type, location, number of reviews, and host information.  

**Model Performance:**  
| Metric | Score |
|---------|-------|
| MAE (Mean Absolute Error) | ≈ 25.7 |
| RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) | ≈ 41.2 |
| R² Score | 0.87 |

✅ The model accurately captured pricing patterns, providing insights for dynamic pricing strategies.

## 💡 Recommendations  

- **Optimize Pricing:** Apply dynamic pricing using real-time demand signals.  
- **Promote Verified Hosts:** Verified hosts receive more trust and better ratings.  
- **Encourage Reviews:** Listings with more positive reviews attract higher bookings.  
- **Enhance Amenities:** Listings with Wi-Fi, air conditioning, and kitchen access perform best.  
- **Neighborhood Focus:** Highlight areas with high ratings and competitive prices.
